# grog_pmsynth

Node based physical modelling synthesizer.  

TODO NODE LIST (links are starting point):  
    - Plucked string generator node (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis)  
    - Bowed string generator node (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Bowed_Strings.html)   
    - Single reed woodwind generator node (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Single_Reed_Instruments.html)  
    - Parameterized sampler (with ability to randomize pitch, length, and stuff)  
    - Convolution operation node  
    - Helmholtz resonance node (Not sure if it's best to simply use a specific ir with convolution instead..)  
    - Basic node (Add, Sub, Delay)  
    - Basic generator node (Noise, Saw, Square, Sin)  
    - Distortion node  
    - Custom node ? (Ability to write a custom node with a custom scripting language for vectorization ?)
